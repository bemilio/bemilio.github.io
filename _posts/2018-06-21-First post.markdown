#So, what will you find in this blog? 

I will write of my electronics and software projects, share some interesting maths and physics that I come across in my studies and hobbies, and in general I will share information that will probably be useful to DIY hobbists like me.

#Who am I?

I am a graduated Electrical Engineering student at an Italian university, now studying Robotics at ETH Zurich. I like to play around with electronics, experiment with simple robots and in general apply what I study for fun.

#Are you excited and you want to check out my work?
